Todoli
======

![Todoli logo](https://github.com/orschiro/todoli/blob/master/static/Favicon190x190.png?raw=true)

Todoli is a very simple, quickly sharable to-do list application written in Python using the Django framework. 
It is largely inspired by [todo.nona.net](http://todo.nona.net/). Yet it comes with some incremental improvements
such as undoing and commenting to-do list entries. I wrote for two reasons:

1. To suit my own need for a to-do list service that is simple, does not require an account and can be quickly shared with others such as team members or friends.
2. To practice my modest programming skills with a useful project that can be deployed and used by others.

Usage 
-----

I am always deploying the latest stable commit on my OpenShift account at [todoli.orzanna.de](http://todoli.orzanna.de). 
It can be used free of charge. Of course you can download the code and host Todoli yourself, either [locally](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ref/django-admin/#runserver-port-or-address-port) or 
by deploying it on your server. Consult the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/deployment/) 
for more information.

Feedback
--------

I will constantly try to improve Todoli. But I am also eager to know how I can improve my code. 
So please provide me feedback. Write me a mail (orschiro at gmail dot com), [submit a ticket](https://github.com/orschiro/todoli/issues)
or [add a to-do](http://todoli.orzanna.de/todoli/todoli-list) to Todoli's own list. Yeah, I know it is cool to use
its own service for that. ;)
